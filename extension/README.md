## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **`<all_urls>`**: To make HTTP requests to any URL for API testing

Data is saved using localStorage (no storage permission required).

Note: `tabs.create()` doesn't require the tabs permission - it's only needed for reading tab data.

## Development

### Building from Source

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Build the extension
cd ..
./build-extension.sh
```

### Making Changes

1. Modify the React app in `frontend/src/`
2. Run `./build-extension.sh` to rebuild
3. Reload the extension in Firefox (about:debugging)

## Storage

The extension uses browser's `localStorage` API to persist:
- Collections and requests
- Variables and contexts
- Request history
- Tab states

Data is stored locally in the browser and is not synced across devices.

## Troubleshooting

### Extension doesn't load
- Check Firefox version (requires Firefox 57+)
- Verify manifest.json is valid
- Check browser console for errors

### Requests fail
- Check that the target URL is accessible
- Verify CORS settings on the API
- Check network tab in browser DevTools

### Data not persisting
- Verify localStorage is enabled in browser
- Check storage quota is not exceeded
- Check for browser storage errors in console

## Known Limitations

- Content Security Policy restrictions on inline scripts
- Some APIs may block requests from extensions
- Storage is limited by browser quota
