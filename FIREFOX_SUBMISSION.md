## Developer Comments (for reviewers)

**Technical Details:**

This extension packages a React application that provides API testing functionality. Key technical aspects:

1. **Permissions Justification:**
   - `<all_urls>`: Required to make HTTP requests to any API endpoint for testing purposes
   - Data is saved using localStorage (no storage permission required)
   - Note: `tabs.create()` doesn't require tabs permission (only needed for reading tab data)

2. **Content Security Policy:**
   - Uses `'unsafe-eval'` to enable custom JavaScript scripting feature
   - This is essential for pre/post-request scripts functionality
   - Scripts run in a sandboxed context with limited API access

3. **Privacy:**
   - No external network requests except user-initiated API tests
   - All data stored in localStorage
   - No analytics, tracking, or telemetry
   - Open source: https://github.com/bohdaq/hitop

4. **Build Process:**
   - React app built with Create React App
   - Uses relative paths (homepage: ".") for extension compatibility
   - Source code available for review

5. **Testing:**
   - Tested on Firefox 58.0+
   - All features functional
   - No known issues

The extension is designed to be a complete API testing solution while maintaining user privacy and security.
